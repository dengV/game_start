> In SpriteKit, a single object called a scene controls each “screen” of your app. Scenes are represented by SpriteKit’s SKScene class.

> Note that GameScene is a subclass of SKScene. SpriteKit calls the method didMove(to:) before it presents your scene in a view; it’s a good place to do some initial setup of your scene’s contents. Here, you simply set the background color to black.

> We’ve designed all the games in this book as universal apps, which means they will work on the iPhone and the iPad.

#### The scenes for the games in this book have been designed with a base size of 2048x1536, or reversed for portrait orientation, with the scale mode set to aspect fill.


Aspect fill instructs SpriteKit to scale the scene’s content to fill the entire screen, even if SpriteKit needs to cut off some of the content to do so.

• iPhone 6/7 [16:9 or 1.77]: Aspect fill will scale a 2048x1152 visible area by 0.64 to fit the 1334x750 screen.
